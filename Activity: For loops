Activity: For loops
Introduction
In this lab, you will practice writing iterative statements using for loops.

As a data professional, you may need to use methods that involve repetition. For example, when analyzing customer feedback from surveys, you may need to compare averages across categories. In Python, using iterative statements helps automate this task and makes it more efficient.

In this activity, you'll continue your work as a junior data analyst for a movie theater. Your next task is to analyze customer feedback data.

Task 1: Iterating with if, elif, and else
In your work as an analyst, you have received customer feedback for a newly launched product. The feedback is a numerical grade on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the best. Understanding the number of customers who responded negatively, neutrally, or positively will help determine how to improve the product.

Define a function called score_counter that accepts the following argument:
score_list - a list of customer-submitted scores, where each score is an integer, 1-10
The function must iterate over the scores in score_list and bin them into three bins:
Negative (scores of 1-5)
Neutral (scores of 6-8)
Positive (scores of 9-10)
The output of the function must be three statements, each on its own line:

'Negative: {number_of_negative_scores}'
'Neutral: {number_of_neutral_scores}'
'Positive: {number_of_positive_scores}'
Example:

 [IN] score_counter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
[OUT] 'Negative: 5'
      'Neutral: 3'
      'Positive: 2'
Note that there is more than one way to solve this problem.

Hint 1
Refer to what you learned about using for loops and if, elif, else statements.

Hint 2
Counters and print statements should not be part of the for loop body.

The body of the for loop should be indented as a block below the for statement. Each conditional statement within the body of the for loop should follow its own indentation syntax.

Hint 3
Use a counter for each category you're counting and make sure to increment one of the counters by 1 for each iteration of the loop.

Use the conditional statements if, elif, and else to sort the responses into their buckets. Make sure to include the correct logical and comparitive operators during the branching instructions.

Task 2: Create a for loop using if, not, and in
There is concern that some of the customer feedback scores are fake. One way to check the integrity of the feedback is to identify how many scores came from verified customers.

In this task, you are provided with two lists: a list of verified customer IDs and a list of all IDs that left feedback scores. You must validate the data by cross-checking the lists against each other.


Define a function called id_validator that takes two lists as arguments:

verified_ids - a list containing IDs of verified customers
feedback_ids - a list containing unique IDs of all posters of feedback scores
The output of the function must be two statements, each on its own line:

'{number_of_unverified_ids} of {number_of_feedback_ids} IDs unverified.'
'{percent} unverified.'
Example 1:

 [IN]  id_validator(verified_ids=['1', '2'], feedback_ids=['1', '2', '3'])
[OUT]  '1 of 3 IDs unverified.'
       '33.33% unverified.'
Explanation:

One of the IDs ('3') in feedback_ids is not in the list of verified_ids.
1/3 of the IDs in feedback_ids are unverified.

Example 2:


 [IN]  id_validator(verified_ids=['1a', '2b', '3c'], feedback_ids=['1a', '4d'])
[OUT]  '1 of 2 IDs unverified.'
       '50.0% unverified.'
Explanation:

One of the IDs ('4d') in feedback_ids is not in the list of verified_ids.
1/2 of the IDs in feedback_ids are unverified.

Note that there is more than one way to solve this problem.

Hint 1
Refer to what you learned about using for loops, if statements, and not and in operators.

Hint 2
Any lines of code within a for loop's body should be indented, including other conditional statements.

Hint 3
Use a counter variable to keep track of the number of IDs you're counting.

Use an if statement to check if an ID from one list is in, or not in, the other list.

Task 3: Create a nested loop
You've been asked to calculate the total value of all purchases made by each customer to understand how many customers have spent $100+.

Write a function called purchases_100 that accepts the following argument:

sales - a list of lists where each inner list contains the prices of items purchased by a unique customer.
The function must return the number of customers whose purchases summed to $100 or more.

Example:

sales = [[2.75], [50.0, 50.0], [150.46, 200.12, 111.30]]

 [IN]  purchases_100(sales)
[OUT]  2
Note that there is more than one way to solve this problem.

####ASNWER#########ASNWER#########ASNWER#########ASNWER#########ASNWER#########ASNWER#########ASNWER#########ASNWER#########ASNWER#########ASNWER#########ASNWER#####​
​
Hint 1
Refer to what you learned about nested for loops.

Hint 2
Try setting:

A counter for the number of inner lists in sales that sum to >= 100
A variable that increments with each price in a given inner list to capture a final sum of the contents of that list.
Hint 3
One approach would be to:
Set a counter to 0
Loop over each customer in the sales list
Set the customer's total purchase price to 0
For each purchase price in that customer's list, increase the customer's total purchase price by that price
If the customer's total purchse price >= 100, increment the counter by 1
Return the counter
