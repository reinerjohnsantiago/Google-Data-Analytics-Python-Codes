Activity: Functions
Introduction
In this lab, you will practice defining functions and returning values, writing clean code, and using comments to scaffold code.

As a data professional, you'll often need to reuse the same block of code more than once when you're writing Python code to automate a certain task. This is why functions are important. You can call functions whenever you need the computer to execute those steps. Python has built-in functions that have already been defined and also provides tools for users to define their own functions.

In this activity, you'll continue your work as a junior data analyst for a movie theater. Your next task is to work with sales data. In particular, you'll define and call a function that calculates the revenue the theater makes depending on the number of tickets sold, then test the function with a new value.

Tips for completing this lab
As you navigate this lab, keep the following tips in mind:

### YOUR CODE HERE ### indicates where you should write code. Be sure to replace this with your own code before running the code cell.

Task 1: Analyze a function
In your work as a data analyst for a movie theater, you're asked to quickly calculate how much the theater has made in sales so far.

In the following cell, analyze the function named total_sales and make note of your observations.

You do not need to run this cell, but if you do it will not produce an output.

# Define a function named `total_sales`
def total_sales():
​
    # Return a value
    return
Hint 1
Hint 2
Hint 3
Task 2: Add a parameter and calculations to the function
As you continue refining your code, imagine that the price of tickets is $7.99. Now you will need to add a parameter to the function definition and the calculation to the function body.

2a: Add a calculation to the function
In this task, update the total_sales function so it returns the value of the number of tickets n multiplied by the price 7.99.

return n * price
def total_sales(n):
    price = 7.99
    return n * price
2b: Call the function
With the calculations added to the total_sales function, test it with a value of 59.

Example:

[IN]  total_sales(59)
[OUT] 471.41
total_sales(59)
471.41
Hint 1
Hint 2
Hint 3
Task 3: Create a function that accepts two values
You learn that the price of tickets is more expensive for opening night, and now you need to create a function that will accept two values and return their total value.

3a: Refine the total_sales function
Update your total_sales function so it accepts two parameters:

price for the price per ticket
num_tickets for the total number of tickets.
Return the product of the two arguments. Use the Python round() function to round the returned value to two decimal places. Refer to the round() Python documentation for more information regarding this function.

def total_sales(price, num_tickets):
    total = price * num_tickets
    return round(total, 2)
3b: Call the function
Then, call the function with the value of 15.99 for price and 1001 for the number of tickets sold (num_tickets).

Example:

[IN]  total_sales(15.99, 1001)
[OUT] 16005.99
total_sales(15.99,1001)
16005.99
Hint 1
Hint 2
Hint 3
Task 4: Test the function with different values
As prices and sales fluctate, your function will need to accept different values and still return the total sales.

In this task, practice calling your function with different values.

Example:

[IN]  total_sales(16.99, 1232)
[OUT] 20931.68

[IN]  total_sales(10.50, 1472)
[OUT] 15456.0

[IN]  total_sales(5.00, 349)
[OUT] 1745.0
# Call `total_sales` with 16.99 price and 1232 num_tickets
total_sales(16.99,1232)
20931.68
10.50,1472
# Call `total_sales` with 10.50 price and 1472 num_tickets
total_sales(10.50,1472)
15456.0
5.00,349
# Call `total_sales` with 5.00 price and 349 num_tickets
total_sales(5.00,349)
1745.0
Hint 1
Hint 2
Hint 3

What are your key takeaways from this lab?

 you.
my takeaway is just try to understand the simple instructions or steps. it really helps a lot defining or doing so clean or correct code. thank you.
