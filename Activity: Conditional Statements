Activity: Conditional Statements
Introduction
In this lab, you will practice using Python operators to perform operations between two variables and write conditional statements.

As a data professional, you'll use conditional statements in your approach to many different tasks using Python. Using Boolean values, conditional statements will determine how a code block is executed based on how a condition is met.

In this activity, you'll continue your work as a junior data analyst for a movie theater. Now, you're examining marketing campaigns. Your next task is to analyze user behavior to determine when a customer's activity has prompted a marketing email.

Tips for completing this lab

Task 1: Define a comparator function
You are a data professional for a movie theater, and your task is to use customers' purchasing data to determine whether or not to send them a marketing email.

Define a function called send_email that accepts the following arguments:
num_visits - the number of times a customer has visited the theater
visits_email - the minimum number of visits the customer must have made for them to receive a marketing email
The function must print either: Send email. or Not enough visits.
Example:

 [IN] send_email(num_visits=3, visits_email=5)
[OUT] 'Not enough visits.'

 [IN] send_email(num_visits=5, visits_email=5)
[OUT] 'Send email.'
Note that there is more than one way to solve this problem.

Send email
Not enough visits
Not enough visits

Task 2: Add logical branching to your function
The theater is offering a promotion where customers who have visited the theater more than a designated number of times will also receive a coupon with their email. Update the function that you created above to include additional logical branching.

Include an additional argument visits_coupon that represents the minimum number of visits the customer must have made for them to receive a coupon with their email.

The function must print one of three possible messages:

Send email with coupon.
Send email only.
Not enough visits.
The minimum number of visits to receive a coupon will always be greater than the number to receive an email only.

Example:

 [IN] send_email(num_visits=3, visits_email=5, visits_coupon=8)
[OUT] 'Not enough visits.'

 [IN] send_email(num_visits=5, visits_email=5, visits_coupon=8)
[OUT] `Send email only.`

 [IN] send_email(num_visits=8, visits_email=5, visits_coupon=8)
[OUT] `Send email with coupon.`
Note that there is more than one way to solve this problem.
