Exemplar: Work with strings in Python
Introduction
In this lab, you'll practice coding in Python and working with strings.

Data professionals work with a lot of string data. For example, while analyzing the results of a marketing campaign, you may need to review item descriptions or customer names, which is stored as string data. Becoming comfortable working with strings in Python is essential for the work of a data professional.

In this activity, you'll continue your work as a junior data analyst for a movie theater. Recently, the movie theater opened an online store that sells items related to the theater and the movies that it shows. Your next task is to collect store data for future analysis. You'll work with a store ID, ZIP Code, and a custom URL for the store you're gathering data on.

Task 1: Check and change data types
Now that you have experience in marketing, you've moved on to market research. Your new task is collecting store data for future analysis. In this task, you're given a four-digit numeric store ID stored in a variable called store_id.

Convert store_id to a string and store the result in the same variable.
Confirm the type of store_id after the conversion.
store_id = 1101
​
# 1. ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
store_id = str(store_id)
​
# 2. ### YOUR CODE HERE ###

####ANSWER########ANSWER########ANSWER########ANSWER########ANSWER########ANSWER########ANSWER########ANSWER####
Task 2: String concatenation
As you continue gathering data, you realize that the store_id variable is actually the ZIP Code where the store is located, but the leading 0 has been cut off.

Define a function called zip_checker that accepts the following argument:

zipcode - a string with either four or five characters
Return:

If zipcode has five characters, and the first two characters are NOT '00', return zipcode as a string. Otherwise, return 'Invalid ZIP Code.'. (ZIP Codes do not begin with 00 in the mainland U.S.)
If zipcode has four characters and the first character is NOT '0', the function must add a zero to the beginning of the string and return the five-character zipcode as a string.
If zipcode has four characters and the first character is '0', the function must return 'Invalid ZIP Code.'.
Example:

 [IN] zip_checker('02806')
[OUT] '02806'

 [IN] zip_checker('2806')
[OUT] '02806'

 [IN] zip_checker('0280')
[OUT] 'Invalid ZIP Code.'

 [IN] zip_checker('00280')
[OUT] 'Invalid ZIP Code.'
Note that there is more than one way to solve this problem.

Task 3: Extract the store ID
Now imagine that you've been provided url, which is a URL containing the store's actual ID at the end of it.

Extract the seven-character store ID from the end of url and assign the result to a variable called id.
Print the contents of id.
url = "https://exampleURL1.com/r626c36"
####ANSWER########ANSWER########ANSWER########ANSWER########ANSWER########ANSWER########ANSWER########ANSWER####​
# 1. ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
id = url[-7:]

# 2. ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
print(id)

####ANSWER########ANSWER########ANSWER########ANSWER########ANSWER########ANSWER########ANSWER########ANSWER####
Task 4: String extraction function
You have many URLs that contain store IDs, but many of them are invalid—either because they use an invalid protocol (the beginning of the URL) or because the store ID is not seven characters long.

The correct URL protocol is https: Anything else is invalid.
A valid store ID must have exactly seven characters.
Define a function called url_checker that accepts the following argument:

url - a URL string
Return:

If both the protocol and the store ID are invalid:
print two lines:
'{protocol} is an invalid protocol.'
'{store_id} is an invalid store ID.'
If only the protocol is invalid:
print:
'{protocol} is an invalid protocol.'
If only the store ID is invalid:
print:
'{store_id} is an invalid store ID.'
If both the protocol and the store ID are valid, return the store ID.
In the above cases, {protocol} is a string of the protocol and {store_id} is a string of the store ID.

Example:

 [IN] url_checker('http://exampleURL1.com/r626c3')
[OUT] 'http: is an invalid protocol.'
      'r626c3 is an invalid store ID.'

 [IN] url_checker('ftps://exampleURL1.com/r626c36')
[OUT] 'ftps: is an invalid protocol.'

 [IN] url_checker('https://exampleURL1.com/r626c3')
[OUT] 'r626c3 is an invalid store ID.'

 [IN] url_checker('https://exampleURL1.com/r626c36')
[OUT] 'r626c36'
Note that there is more than one way to solve this problem.
