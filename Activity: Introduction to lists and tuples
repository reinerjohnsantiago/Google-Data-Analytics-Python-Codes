Introduction
In this lab, you will practice creating, modifying, and working with data structures in Python. This will develop your knowledge of different kinds of data structures and the different operations that you can perform with them to answer questions about the data. This will help you prepare for projects you may encounter where you will need to use data structures to store and keep track of data.

This activity is based on the following scenario: You are a junior data analyst working for an environmental research team that focuses on air quality.

Your team has received data collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Your goal is to store and organize this data, so that it can be accessed and updated easily.

In this lab, you'll be working specifically with the state names and county names of places that reported air quality index readings.

Task 1: Create lists and use tuples
As you continue your work with the EPA data, you want to create an ordered data structure containing pairs of values, which can be iterated over to gain insights from the data.

1a: Create lists
You'll work with state names and county names indicated below.

state_name	county_name
Arizona	Maricopa
California	Alameda
California	Sacramento
Kentucky	Jefferson
Louisiana	East Baton Rouge

In this task, assign two variables:

state_names - a list of each state in the state_name column in the table above, in order, as strings
county_names - a list of each county in the county_name column in the table above, in order, as strings
# 1. ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
state_names = ["Arizona", "California", "California", "Kentucky", "Louisiana"]
print(state_names)
# 2. ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
county_names = ["Maricopa", "Alameda", "Sacramento", "Jefferson", "East Baton Rouge"]
print(county_names)
['Arizona', 'California', 'California', 'Kentucky', 'Louisiana']
['Maricopa', 'Alameda', 'Sacramento', 'Jefferson', 'East Baton Rouge']
Hint
1b: Use a loop to combine the lists into a single list of tuples
Use state_names and county_names to:
Create a new list of tuples, where each tuple contains a pair of state name and county name.
Assign the new list to a variable called state_county_tuples.
Print the result
Expected result:

[OUT] [('Arizona', 'Maricopa'),
       ('California', 'Alameda'),
       ('California', 'Sacramento'),
       ('Kentucky', 'Jefferson'),
       ('Louisiana', 'East Baton Rouge')]
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
state_county_tuples = []
for i in range(len(state_names)):
    state_county_tuples.append((state_names[i], county_names[i]))
state_county_tuples
[('Arizona', 'Maricopa'),
 ('California', 'Alameda'),
 ('California', 'Sacramento'),
 ('Kentucky', 'Jefferson'),
 ('Louisiana', 'East Baton Rouge')]
Hint 1
There are several ways to accomplish this task. One way could involve looping over the elements of each list and, with each iteration, assigning a tuple consisting of (state_names[i], county_names[i]), which could then be used to build the state_county_tuples list.

Hint 2
Use the len() function and the range() function to generate the appropriate number of iterations for a for loop.

Hint 3
Instantiate state_county_tuples as an empty list
Write a for loop to iterate over range(len(state_names))
With each iteration, append (state_names[i], county_names[i]) to state_county_tuples
1c: Use the zip() function to combine the lists into a single list of tuples
Python has a built-in function to make the above process much easier. It's called the zip() function. This function accepts any number of iterable objects as arguments. If the arguments are all of equal length, the function returns an iterator object of tuples, where each tuple contains element[i] of each argument.

You can then either loop over the iterator object or pass it to the list() function to unpack its values.

Refer to the zip() Python documentation for more information.

Here's an example:

# RUN THIS CELL
a = ['a', 'b', 'c']
b = [1, 2, 3]
c = zip(a, b)
​
print(c)
print(list(c))
<zip object at 0x7ba5c83fe230>
[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
Use the zip() function to generate the same output created in Task 1b.

Use state_names and county_names to:
Create a new list of tuples, where each tuple contains a pair of state name and county name.
Assign the new list to a variable called state_county_zipped.
Check that state_county_zipped is the same as state_county_tuples.
)
# 1. ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
state_county_zipped = list(zip(state_names, county_names))
print(state_county_zipped)
# 2. ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
state_county_zipped == state_county_tuples
[('Arizona', 'Maricopa'), ('California', 'Alameda'), ('California', 'Sacramento'), ('Kentucky', 'Jefferson'), ('Louisiana', 'East Baton Rouge')]
True
Hint 1
Refer to the example of the zip() function provided above.

Hint 2
Don't forget to convert the result of the zip operation to a list.

Hint 3
Use list(zip(state_names, county_names)) and assign the result to state_county_zipped.

Test for equality with state_county_tuples using the == operator.

Task 2: Use list comprehension to convert to list of lists
Since tuples are immutable and can't be changed, converting tuples to lists is a practice data professionals use so they can make adjustments to the data, if necessary.

Use a list comprehension to convert state_county_tuples from a list of tuples to a list of lists. Assign the result to a variable called state_county_lists.

Print the result.

Expected result:

[OUT] [['Arizona', 'Maricopa'],
       ['California', 'Alameda'],
       ['California', 'Sacramento'],
       ['Kentucky', 'Jefferson'],
       ['Louisiana', 'East Baton Rouge']]
### YOUR CODE HERE
state_county_list = [list(i)for i in state_county_tuples]
state_county_list
[['Arizona', 'Maricopa'],
 ['California', 'Alameda'],
 ['California', 'Sacramento'],
 ['Kentucky', 'Jefferson'],
 ['Louisiana', 'East Baton Rouge']]
Hint 1
Refer to what you've learned about list comprehension.

Hint 2
Remember that list comprehensions are like loops written in reverse:

[{operation to perform} for {element} in {iterable}]

Hint 3
There are multiple ways to perform this operation. The simplest uses the list() function on each element in state_county_zipped.

Another way is to use indexing to unpack each tuple into a list.

[[i[0], i[1]] for i in state_county_tuples]

Task 3: Unpacking an iterable
Data professionals often use the technique of unpacking to work with individual elements of iterable objects. As you continue in your work as an analyst, you are asked to iterate through your list of state/county pairs to identify only the counties in California.

As a refresher, here is the data you have been working with:

state_name	county_name
Arizona	Maricopa
California	Alameda
California	Sacramento
Kentucky	Jefferson
Louisiana	East Baton Rouge
3a: Unpacking in a loop
Write a loop that unpacks each tuple in state_county_tuples and, if the state in the tuple is California, add the corresponding county to a list called ca_counties.
Expected output:

[OUT] ['Alameda', 'Sacramento']
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
ca_counties = []
for state, county in state_county_tuples:
    if state=='California':
        ca_counties.append(county)
ca_counties
['Alameda', 'Sacramento']
Hint 1
Refer to what you learned about unpacking tuples, for loops, conditional statements, and list methods.

Hint 2
To unpack a tuple in a loop, you must assign each of its elements to a variable. Each tuple in state_county_tuples has two elements, so instead of writing for a in x, you must write for a, b in x.

Hint 3
Instantiate the ca_counties list before you begin writing your loop.

With each iteration of the loop:

Unpack each tuple in state_county_tuples:
for state, county in state_county_tuples:
Check whether state is California:
if state == 'California':
If it is, append county to ca_counties:
ca_counties.append(county)
3b: Unpacking in a list comprehension
Now, use a list comprehension to accomplish the same thing as what you did in Task 3a.

In a list comprehension, unpack each tuple in state_county_tuples and, if the state in the tuple is California, add the corresponding county to the list comprehension.

Assign the result to a variable called ca_counties.

Print ca_counties.

Expected output:

[OUT] ['Alameda', 'Sacramento']
y
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
ca_counties = [county for (state, county) in state_county_tuples if state=='California']
ca_counties
['Alameda', 'Sacramento']
Hint 1
Refer to what you learned about list comprehension syntax. Also refer to previous tasks and examples in this lab.

Hint 2
It can be helpful to progress towards the goal in smaller steps. For example, first try to create a list comprehension that unpacks the county from each state, county pair, resulting in a list of all the counties.

If you can do that, then tweak the list comprehension by adding a conditional statement that only keeps the county if its corresponding state is California.

Hint 3
Consider the following syntax:

[___ for (___, ___) in _________ if __________]
